1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

A regular expression is function that takes in a set of rules that can be used to parse through text and find all that match the given set of rules. Such as all words starting with a capital letter or those that are hyperlinks. Regular expressions can be used to moderate forums to look for keywords such as phone numbers or bad words and replace all it finds with **** or with an appropriate alternative word or message. One of the best things about the expressions is that it translates easily across various coding languages because at the heart of it. It is bascially an algorithm with no language specific parts.

2. What is an array and how does it work?
An array is a zero indexed based data structure of elements of the same type stored in a contiguos block of memory. Arrays are the most time and space effecient data structure we have at our disposal. It has constant time for accesing stored data. For deletion and insertion arrays has a worst case runtime of a linear time complexity. This is because to delete and insert data it has to move and shift all the other data to either make space for the new data or compensate for the loss of data. Searching also is linear because their is no way to tell if what we are looking for is at the beginning or the end of an array. So worst case we might have to loop through each index to find what we are looking for.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?
Hashtables are considered by some to be the most important data structure. Hashtables are the basis of dictionaries in python and objects in javascript. At the core of hashtables are arrays. Hashtables use arrays as its container for its key value pairs. To create a hashtable first a capacity needs to be chosen to decide the storage size it next takes the capacity and times it by None to create an array with None place holders which help maintain the structure. Next to add items to the hash table a key is "hashed" meaning it is ran through a function such as the djb2 hash function and creates a new number based off the djb2 and it also takes a second argument the capacity of the hash table and uses the new number with a modulo function using the capcity to create an index where to store the value. In light of this, hashtables have a costant time complexity for insertion,deletion and search. Search is constant beacuse all you need to know is the key and run it through the hash function to get the index the value is stored at. To insert a value it will just replace the None at its chosen index therefore not needing to rearrange the whole array and similarily to delete the function will just need to repalce the data at the given index with None. A problem with hashtables is the so called birthday problem which states that if you have enough people in a room eventually you will find two people with the same birthday. For the puropse of hashtables this means a problem called collision can happen when to similar keys or hash values collide by trying to get saved to the same place. To combat this we can have linked list pairs to chain the items in the shared index. The problem with this is that eventually when you want to search your going to have to go through possibly each link to find what you want leading to a linear runtime. A way we can mitigate this is by resizing the data structure and rehashing the items to different indexes to spread out the data to seperate indexes.
